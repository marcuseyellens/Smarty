Ethernet Smart Contracts and DApp Development Framework and EngineeringÔºåbased on [React](http://reactjs.org/) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

The buzzwordy way to describe Dapp Lab is as a "privacy-first, encrypted personal finance app". Try out the free "no-account" mode to get a feel for the complete experience without having to sign up. Or, jump straight into the [user docs](docs/user/README.md) to learn how to host Dapp Lab yourself (or how to build it as a [native app](docs/user/README.md#native-app-without-backend)).

## About Dapp Lab

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/uFincs_Dashboard.png" alt="Dapp Lab Dashboard" />
</div>

For the more technically minded, Dapp Lab is a personal finance app with the following characteristics:

- **It's a web app**
  - Specifically, it's an offline-first PWA. That means that once you're logged-in, you can use the app without an internet connection. Heck, you can even use the app without an account!
- **But also a 'native' app**
  - We use [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) to wrap the Dapp Lab PWA into Android, iOS, and Electron apps (but you have to compile them yourself). Combined with Dapp Lab' no-account mode, that means you can run Dapp Lab completely standalone, without having to deal with setting up the backend API or database.
- **It encrypts your data**
  - All data is encrypted in-browser (or in-app) before it is sent off to be persisted in the backend database. This provides a layer of security that few other apps can boast.
- **It forces you to enter transactions manually**
  - You won't find any bank syncing here like other finance apps do. Nope, Dapp Lab is built on the principal of tirelessly tracking each and every penny ‚Äî _by hand_.
- **But it does support CSV import...**
  - This is one of the concessions to the 'manual tracking'. Grab a CSV of your transactions from your bank and you can import them directly into the app.
- **... and recurring transactions**
  - OK, we're not completely heartless about the 'enter everything manually' goal. Recurring transactions certainly help cut down on some of that work.
- **It also kinda allows custom integrations**
  - What? You _really_ want bank syncing? Fine, check out the [api-proxy-prototype](https://github.com/Dapp Lab/api-proxy-prototype) to learn how you can build your own custom bank syncing integration. Just know that it'll never be supported as a first-class feature :)
- **It supports precisely one currency**
  - You can change which currency symbol is displayed throughout the app, but there is no multi-currency support in Dapp Lab.

What does Dapp Lab _not_ do (and likely will never do)?

- **Bank syncing**
  - This was addressed above.
- **Multiple currencies**
  - Also addressed above.
- **Budgeting**
  - Double-entry accounting or bust.
- **Track stock prices**
  - ... or do any other kind of 'external' integration for that matter. Dapp Lab is a self-contained system; if you want custom external integrations, you can build them yourself (using, for example, the [api-proxy-prototype](https://github.com/Dapp Lab/api-proxy-prototype) as a base).

## Roadmap

Frankly, Dapp Lab has met and exceeded my own expectations and use cases. As such, it does not have an active roadmap ‚Äî I just work on what I want when I feel like it.
